blurb: "I've always enjoyed ranking experiences and things I'm passionate about. This begins the 
first of my journal entries from my Asia trip, where I try to tell stories through rankings. Today,
we're starting with the mundane: grading the metro systems of Asia through different dimensions."

# Overview

Yes, I also did the proverbial post-grad Asia trip. As I write this on a bus towards the Izu
Peninsula, I thought I would recount my experiences so far in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, where
I visited in June 2023, as well as Singapore, which I visited in April 2023.

From NBA players to Japanese city pop songs, it's no secret among my friends that I love to get
into heated debates about which ones are the "best". But even though Kevin Durant is the best in my
heart, I know I'd be delusional to say he's the overall greatest basketball player of all time. I
think it's a lot more sensible to rank with certain _criteria_, or dimensions by which we can
evaluate different classes of something.

# Criteria

In the context of public transit, there are a few areas that I pay the most attention to. To zero
in on the transit and avoid politics, I won't be considering safety (though all of these cities
are incredibly safe to begin with). The dimensions I'll be considering are as follows:

- **Reliability**. As a tourist, I admittedly wasn't as focused on reliability, but arriving
  on schedule is key to commuters and travelers alike. If there are faults, are they addressed and
  broadcasted widely?

- **Efficiency**. Are ridiculously annoying transfers (think 42 St Times Sq -> Port Authority in
  New York) commonplace? Also, is the integration with other modes of transit, like buses and trams,
  easy to navigate?

- **Technology**. How modern are the traincars and information displays? Also, do fare entrances
  have high throughput and are they easy to use?

- **Accessibility**. Are there significant accomodations for those with disabilities? Also, for
  non-native language speakers, do communications support multiple languages, or is the network
  easy to navigate without understanding a single word?

- **Comfort**. Are traincars overly packed to the point of having to go for the next train? Do
  stations have A/C, and are they pleasant to walk around?

And one final disclaimer before we get startedâ€”I'm certainly not a civil engineering or urban
planning expert, and I'm speaking on limited experiences from about a week's stay at each city.
These rankings are mostly based on opinion and anecdotal evidence, though I would collect data
or do some more involved analysis if I actually lived there.
