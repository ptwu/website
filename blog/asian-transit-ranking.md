blurb: "I've always enjoyed ranking experiences and things I'm passionate about. This begins the 
first of my journal entries from my Asia trip, where I try to tell stories through rankings. Today,
we're starting with the mundane: grading the metro systems of Asia through different dimensions."

# Overview

Yes, I also did the proverbial post-grad Asia trip. As I write this on a bus towards the Izu
Peninsula, I thought I would recount my experiences so far in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, where
I visited in June 2023, as well as Singapore, which I visited in April 2023.

From NBA players to Japanese city pop songs, it's no secret among my friends that I love to get
into heated debates about which ones are the "best". But even though Kevin Durant is the best in my
heart, I know I'd be delusional to say he's the overall greatest basketball player of all time. I
think it's a lot more sensible to rank with certain _criteria_, or dimensions by which we can
evaluate different classes of something.

(As of 7/9, I haven't uploaded any images yet. But expect some additional photos in this article
eventually.)

# Criteria

In the context of public transit, there are a few areas where I pay the most attention. To zero
in on the transit and avoid politics, I won't be considering safety (though all of these cities
are incredibly safe to begin with). The dimensions I'll be considering are as follows:

- **Reliability**. As a tourist, I admittedly wasn't as focused on reliability, but arriving
  on schedule is key to commuters and travelers alike. If there are faults, are they addressed and
  broadcasted widely?

- **Efficiency**. Are ridiculously annoying transfers (think 42 St Times Sq -> Port Authority in
  New York) commonplace? Also, is the integration with other modes of transit, like buses and trams,
  easy to navigate?

- **Technology**. How modern are the traincars and information displays? Also, do fare entrances
  have high throughput and are they easy to use?

- **Accessibility**. Are there significant accomodations for those with disabilities? Also, for
  non-native language speakers, do communications support multiple languages, or is the network
  easy to navigate without understanding a single word?

- **Comfort**. Are traincars overly packed to the point of having to go for the next train? Do
  stations have A/C, and are they pleasant to walk around?

And one final disclaimer before we get startedâ€”I'm certainly not a civil engineering or urban
planning expert, and I'm speaking on limited experiences from about a week's stay at each city.
These rankings are mostly based on opinion and anecdotal evidence, though I would collect data
or do some more involved analysis if I actually lived there.

# Rankings

We'll be conducting rankings conditioned on the dimensions described above before tallying them
and trying to come up with a notion of overall rankings. Let's get started!

## Reliability

**1. Tokyo**

In NYC, sometimes I hope for my train to be a bit late so I can speedwalk instead of sprint. But
in Tokyo, that's simply not an option. Despite having the busiest rail station in the world,
you can always count on your trains in Tokyo to be on time, plus or minus one minute.
Additionally, they have extremely transparent information on display in many trains about possible
delays due to unforeseen events or natural disasters like earthquakes.

**2. Singapore**

As probably the most technologically advanced city on this list, Singapore's trains run incredibly
reliably. I'm not certain whether I've ever experienced a delay more than 3 minutes in Singapore's
MRT, but admittedly I was only there for a couple days.

**3. Seoul**

Seoul's metro system is quite reliable. But I've seen some trains get delayed for more than a couple
minutes, and others disregarding the scheduled times by departing slightly early. That being said, I
do think the frequency of the lines makes up for the possibility of missing the trains.

**4. Taipei**

It's not like Taipei is any slouch with the reliability of its metro system. But the Taipei MRT
has some inconsistent reporting to Google Maps, and I've personally been on a train scheduled
right before the final departure on the line that ended up being the actual final departure (this
wasted like 15 minutes). The other cities just have such a high bar of reliability that makes it
hard to compete.

## Efficiency

**1. Seoul**

I think Seoul has the best subway transfer experience in the world. Never has it been easier to
see where exactly to go based on the signage and information provided. In addition to Naver Map
and Kakao Map (Korea's de facto navigation apps) providing information on which exact subway car
to board for the fastest transfer, Seoul has an exceptionally easy-to-access bus system with
close locality to all metro stations.

**2. Tokyo**

**3. Taipei**

**4. Singapore**
