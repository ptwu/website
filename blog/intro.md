Eventually I'll be replacing this entry with an actual first post, but this is my new website and
blog that I implemented from scratch with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Working with web technologies
has been a good change of pace from all my research recently, and it's good to actually have a
visual way of debugging things. I also continue to be pleasantly surprised by the elegance of
Next.js: I'm a pretty opinionated person, and I like my tooling as opinionated as possible. Working
with `react-router` and MaterialUI for every project eventually gets old, and I for one certainly
don't miss running `yarn add` for every package under the sun (yes I still use Yarn in 2023).
Tailwind is a bit more controversial, and I completely get the critics. I feel like we're returning
to the old inline CSS styling ugliness from 10 years ago and clouding our concerns together. But
combined with React, the speed of development with Tailwind has been incredibleâ€”I only spent a day
and a half implementing this website.

In any case, stick around! I plan on adding some blog posts about my systems research and random
other software quirks. The only thing I can promise about them is that they aren't going to be
proofread.
