blurb: "I was pretty surprised to find a lack of good C++/C# interop resources online for Linux, given that most of the online tutorials were for C++/CLI, which only works with Windows. Here, we'll explore the basics, internals, and gory bits like making pointers to native memory safely, with some remarks on performance."

# Getting started

If there's one thing I could convey before skimming the article or moving onto another blog post,
if you're looking to make C++/C# interop work on Linux, **ignore any resources to do with C++/CLI.**
C++/CLI is a part of the Common Language Infrastructure and built into Microsoft's Visual Studio,
but [they have no plans to include it in .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2508) anytime soon.

To get started, you'll need:

- Linux OS installation
- Your favorite C++ compiler
- [The .NET SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)

# Managed and unmanaged code

Some key vocabulary to know when delving into C++ <-> C#/Java interop are the notions of **managed**
and **unmanaged** code. **Unmanaged**, or "native" code is executed directly by the operating system
without the use of any runtime environment: think low-level or assembly languages, or languages
typically directly compiled to Assembly such as C++ or Rust that can be executed by the CPU without
any intermediate steps.

On the other hand, **managed** code refers to, you guessed it, programs executed within a runtime
environment such as the .NET Framework or the Java Virtual Machine. These programs have automatic
memory management, security features, and other services, but with no free lunchâ€”also incurring
an additional overhead. A common design pattern among managed languages is **just-in-time
compilation** (JIT). Managed code compiled in the runtime environment is first transpiled to an
intermediate language: in C# specifically, this is the .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
Once the code actually needs to be run, it is compiled to native assembly, which can actually be
executed by the CPU. This is convenient to make sure your code "just works" in all environments,
as long as they offer .NET or JVM support or whatnot.

Our goal here is to allow communication between the managed and unmanaged parts of a codebase. In
this article, I will use {C++, unmanaged} and {C#, managed} interchangably.

# Basics of marshalling

One more thing before we get started with the actual interop code. To get a good footing on the
performance of interoperability between C++ and C#, we need to talk about **marshalling**.
Marshalling is the process of transforming data between different representations or formats between
two languages. Unfortunately, a `std::string` from C++ isn't so easily passed over to C# without
extra work: `std::string` differs highly in representation from compiler to compiler, and more
importantly, is within unmanaged memory; the `System.String` data in C# are garbage collected and
do not have an explicit memory address on the heap, and is subject to change at any time during
program execution.

If you want the simplest plug-and-play between C++ and C# types, you can use the `MarshalAs`
attribute when passing managed data types to unmanaged code that have predefined marshalling rules
(these are implemented through the [`ICustomMarshaler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.icustommarshaler?view=net-7.0)).

The interface is as follows:

```cpp
MyFunction(char* string) // Within some C++ DLL.
```

```cs
MyFunction([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string) // Within some C# DLL.
```

The `Unmanaged.LPStr` indicates that the C# string should be marshalled as a null-terminated ANSI
string, since the C++ side expects a traditional C string. See below for a diagram on
how it fits all together with respect to memory layouts!

![The anatomy of unmanaged and managed memory layouts, and how marshalling occurs to convert types between them.](/unmanagedmanaged.png)

_Insight: Make sure to marshal types between C++ and C# that are not blittable; see next section for
the definition of this._

## Blittable types

Many common data types have a common representation in both unmanaged and managed memory, and do
not require [special handling by the interop marshaler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/blittable-and-non-blittable-types).
While they may still be copied, each of them have a tiny representation in memory so it can be done
exceptionally efficiently. The blittable types are listed below, with their C++ counterpart:

```cpp
// preferring standardized types which don't differ based on implementation
System.Byte <-> uint8_t
System.SByte <-> int8_t
System.Int16 <-> int16_t
System.UInt16 <-> uint16_t
System.Int32 <-> int32_t
System.UInt32 <-> uint32_t
System.Int64 <-> int64_t
System.UInt64 <-> uint64_t
System.IntPtr <-> void* // or any pointer type, but will be an opaque pointer in C#
System.UIntPtr <-> void*
System.Single <-> float
System.Double <-> double
```

_Insight: Prefer blittable types in interop scenarios whenever possible, whether it be function
parameters or struct fields. If you have extremely complicated data structures, try to break down
function calls between C++ and C# to the truly necessary parts._

# Your C++/C# interop options

## Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)

Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) is a built-in interface in the `System` and
`System.Runtime.InteropServices` namespaces of C#, so no external installation required.
The mechanism is very simple for calling unmanaged code from managed code, but going the other
way around is a little verbose.

### Calling C++ (or even C) code from C#

To start, let's define a C++ library for use in C#. A very important thing to note is that **all
C++ code must have C-style linkage in order to be used in C#.**. This means that you cannot use
templates or other C++ constructs explicitly in your function.

```cpp
// Need to use extern "C" to give any exported functions C linkage.
// To clean up your code, I usually use a macro: #define EXPORT extern "C"

extern "C" int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Now, compile the C++ code to a dynamically-linked library (DLL). This allows external programs
to call into the function through a given file, usually in `.so` format. Using gcc,

```bash
g++ -c -fPIC example.cpp -o example.o  # Compile the code without linking it into an executable
g++ -shared example.o -o libexample.so # Link the object file into a shared library
```

Call into it in C#:

```
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleCSharpApplication
{
    [DllImport("libexample.so")]
    public static extern int add(int a, int b);

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int result = add(2, 3); // this is executed in unmanaged code
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

### Calling C# code from C++

On the other hand, calling C# code from C++ is a little more complicated. Given some managed code
you want to call, you will need to create a delegate and pass it as a callback to the unmanaged
side. See below for a working example.

```cs
// ExampleCSharpLibrary.cs
// This is the main C# library we want to wrap and call in C++.

using System;

public delegate void MyDelegate(int arg);

public static class ExampleCSharpLibrary
{
    public static void MyMethod(int arg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyMethod called with argument: " + arg);
    }
}
```

In this example, we're defining a delegate type called `MyDelegate`. We're also defining a static
method called `MyMethod`, which has one (blittable) argument for brevity.

Now, export a function in C++ that takes a function pointer as a parameter:

```cpp
// ExampleCppApplication.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

typedef std::function<void(int)> MyDelegate;

extern "C" void CallManagedFunction(MyDelegate callback)
{
    callback(42);
}
```

Finally, to actually invoke the C# code in C++, you'll need to have a higher order function
that wraps the `MyDelegate` function type. This allows the C++ code to use `CallManagedFunction`
to call `MyDelegate`.

```cs
// ExampleCSharpApplication.cs

using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleCSharpApplication
{
    [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public delegate void MyDelegate(int arg);

    [DllImport("ExampleCppApplication.dll")]
    public static extern void CallManagedFunction(MyDelegate callback);

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MyDelegate callback = new MyDelegate(ExampleCSharpLibrary.MyMethod);
        CallManagedFunction(callback);
    }
}
```

_Insight: Use P/Invoke as a first choice if C++ headers are installed as system headers, which
make their shared libraries accessible by name. Also, all C++ exported functions must have
C-style linkage._

## Command Language Runtime (CLR) Hosting

If you don't know the name of your C++ DLL a priori, or you want full control of the
lifetime of the .NET runtime environment, go with common language runtime (CLR) hosting.
Essentially, this entails writing custom infrastructure to load the CoreCLR components and start
the runtime.

I've implemented this as part of my research, and one of the few useful articles I've found is
by Igor Ladnik on CodeProject. Read more [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1276328/Hosting-NET-Core-Components-in-Unmanaged-C-Cpluspl).

# Gory stuff: working with native memory in managed code

If you don't plan to use C++/C# interop for extremely performance-critical scenarios (below the ms
level), you don't need to read this section.

However, if you're in a position where avoiding the overhead of a `memcpy` is essential, you will
absolutely need to access native memory via pointers, as marshalling data has a copying overhead.

## Pinned memory and `unsafe`

C# offers us the awesome (and dangerous) option to allocate unmanaged memory within managed code
through the `unsafe` keyword and the `System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal` library. By using
the `unsafe` keyword, a C# function can use pointers just like C++:

```cs
// Note the `unsafe` keyword, which allows us to use pointers.
unsafe static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int x = 10;
    int* p = &x;
    *p = 20; // x now stores 20.
}
```

From our discussion of managed and unmanaged code, managed code is usually marked by using garbage
collection. With garbage collection comes great liberties, but less guarantees: managed objects
are commonly moved around to avoid fragmentation and to allow optimizations. So our pointer `p`
might get garbage collected during execution. To avoid this, we have two options (1) use the `fixed`
keyword, to explicitly pin the pointer within a given scope, or (2) using `GCHandle` to pin it
so it can be passed as a variable. I prefer (2), since we typically want to pin memory longer
than the execution of a single function anyway. Just make sure to free the pointer before you're
done with `Marshal.FreeHGlobal`.

This allows us to allocate native memory with `Marshal.AllocHGlobal` and convert C# structures to
pointers through `Marshal.StructureToPtr`, among much more.

## Safely handling pointers

A useful construct to follow when working with native memory pointers owned on the C# side is
to use a try/catch/finally structure, as in the below code I used in my Cascade research:

```cs
IntPtr emitKeyPtr = Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi("some string");
IntPtr emitBytesPtr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(1);
try
{
    Int32 val = 1;
    Marshal.StructureToPtr(val, emitBytesPtr);
    emit(emitKeyPtr, emitBytesPtr);
}
catch (Exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Exception caught when emitting data.");
}
finally
{
    // Avoid memory leaks by freeing all memory allocated here.
    Marshal.FreeHGlobal(emitKeyPtr);
    Marshal.FreeHGlobal(emitBytesPtr);
}
```

Consider if we reach an exception and execution is interrupted after the memory is allocated to
either the key or bytes pointers, which are passed to the emit function. Then, we will never have
deallocated memory, and resulted in a memory leak. The finally block ensures that we donâ€™t forget to
free the memory in either case after they are used in the emit function.

# Case study: Cascade

The original purpose I had for implementing C++/C# interop was for the Cascade system. You can
read more about how I did it in the [paper I wrote here](/cascade_cs_writeup.pdf). There's also
a good bit on the performance of the system, which is based on hosting the CLR.
